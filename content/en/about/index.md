<h2>$ whoami</h2>
My name is Jacob Kollasch, and I'm a Network Engineer based out of Minneapolis, MN. I am a certified CCNP enterprise, CCNA Devent, and Security+ professional. Currently, I am working on expanding my knowledge and skill set to focus more on Network Security and Cyber Security. My IT journey started in 2017 when I enrolled at Hennepin Technical College to earn a degree in Network Administration. While in school and studying to earn my CCNA, I started work fixing phones and computers, then moved onto application tech support. After graduation, I began working as an IT service desk analyst. Eventually, I took a job as an associate network consultant engineer where I was fortunate to work for the past 2 years where I received hands on experience working on dozens of customer networks, and getting to touch equipment from a variety of network vendors.

<h2>Why did I start a blog?</h2>
I created this blog to achieve the following goals:

1. Document my learning path structured around industry approved certifcations
    - Certifications can provide a focused learning template for knowledge you will use on the job. They allow demonstration of that gained knowledge through an exam, and provide you with a verifible certification to show employers. However, **you only get out what you put in.**
    - Certifications I will use as a guide for content creation that I have earned, or are currently pursuing    
        - **Cisco SCOR** (In Progress), **CCNP Enterprise** (**ENCOR** and **ENARSI**), **CCNA**, **CCNA DevNet**, and **Security+**. 
2. Demonstrate technical knowledge of industry standard tools
    - Learn tools engineers actually get paid to use everyday.
    - Build a collection of useful how-to and refrence guides accesible online to anyone.
3. Improve my writing skills
    - Writing is the best way to organize your thoughts, and prove what you really know about a subject. I want to prove to myself what I know about network security, but most importanly find out what I don't know. Then focus on my areas of weakness.
4. Help others learn networking and cybersecurity
    - The number of times I have learned something useful, or got myself unstuck thanks to a blog like this is astronomical. It's time to pay it forward.
